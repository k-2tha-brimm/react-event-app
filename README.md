# React Events Application

## Technological Overview

This is a SPA for users to browse and expore various events, from concerts to conventions. The app will pull from an Events API and list upcoming events that users can click on for additional details.

Users will be able to edit an event category to reflect their perception of how the event should be classified. After all, the customer is always right!

Implementation details forthcoming.
